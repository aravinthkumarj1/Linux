1) Auth = open 
	=> if we set WEP cipher. 
	=> it check the password lenth match with default one.it didn't check what we enter.
	=> Default lenth is { 5, 10, 13, 26 char}.
	?> open key authentication is not allowed for WPA/WPA2/Mixed mode.(It show connecting..).

2) Auth = shared
        => if we set WEP cipher.
	=> it check the password if it match with pre defined one. 
	=> Then connection established.
	?> If enter wrong password, it didn't connected and didn't show it is wrong password error mesage.
	?> Shared key authentication is not allowed for Open/WPA/WPA2/Mixed mode.(uap can't start..).

3) Auth = WPA/WPA2/mixed mode
	
	=> we can't set EAP with this method.
	=> But client side it ask EAP method.










Note:
	=> Auth = auto allowed only Open and WEP.
	=> If we need 802.1x Auth, we set WPA/WPA2/Mixed mode,set cipher is TKIP/AES.enable KEY_MGMT_EAP.
