Build the u-boot image

Export arm to ARCH
#export ARCH=arm 

Export freescale path to PATH
#export PATH=$PATH:/opt/freescale/usr/local/gcc-4.6.2-glibc-2.13-linaro-multilib-2011.12/fsl-linaro-toolchain/bin 

Export Cross compiler path
#export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- 

#make


[Do the kernel patch]


Build the kernel image

Export arm to ARCH
export ARCH=arm 

Export freescale path to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/freescale/usr/local/gcc-4.6.2-glibc-2.13-linaro-multilib-2011.12/fsl-linaro-toolchain/bin 

Export Cross compiler path
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

Build Defconfig using below command
make imx6s_defconfig 

Changes in kernel need to be done using make menuconfig comman as follows
make menuconfig 
options:------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Run make menuconfig from a directory where your kernel sources are present. check below following menu tweak order in your GUI: 

#make menuconfig

After checking the GUI need to build kernel image (uImage), Procedure to build uImage: 

#make -j4
#make uImage
